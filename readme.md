# Linear Regression
An implementation of linear regression from scratch. I want to work with linear regression at the lowest level, down to the fractions and derivatives.  
The goal is to use as little external help and libraries/packages as possible. I have allowed myself only the numpy library to develop the linear regression algorithm. However, the model is evaluated using sklearn and pandas.
